That is my programs, that I wrote during the 8 semestr of
system programming (though there is not anything about systems).

The projects are written in Go language (the archiver was previously
written in Haskell -- see "har").

The "gar" stands for Go archiver. And surprisingly its an archiver, that implements two algorithms:
RLE and Huffman.

The "drpn" stands for "deikstras reverse polish notation". Thats exactly what its sounds like.
